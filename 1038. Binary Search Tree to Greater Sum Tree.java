//Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to 
//the original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.

//As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:
//The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
//The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
//Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
