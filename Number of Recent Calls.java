//You have a RecentCounter class which counts the number of recent requests within a certain time frame.
//Implement the RecentCounter class:
//RecentCounter() Initializes the counter with zero recent requests.
//int ping(int t) Adds a new request at time t, where t represents some time in milliseconds, and returns the number of requests 
//that has happened in the past 3000 milliseconds (including the new request). 
//Specifically, return the number of requests that have happened in the inclusive range [t - 3000, t].
//It is guaranteed that every call to ping uses a strictly larger value of t than the previous call.

class RecentCounter {
    private static final int[] records = new int[10000]; //
    private int start;
    private int end;

    public RecentCounter() {        
        start = 0;
        end = 0;
    }
    
    public int ping(int t) {
        while (start < end && (t - records[start] > 3000)) { 
            start++; // if the difference in time is greater than 3000ms, 
            // than increase the value of start unitl it's equal or less than 3000ms.
        }
        records[end++] = t; // Inserting the current time at the end
        return end - start; // Returning the answer including the element added just now.
    }
}
