//Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using multiplication, division, and mod operator.
//The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example, 8.345 would be truncated to 8, and -2.7335 would be truncated to -2.
//Return the quotient after dividing dividend by divisor.

//SOLUTION:

class Solution {
    public int divide(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 1) {
            return a;
        }
        if (a == Integer.MIN_VALUE && b == -1) {
            return Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        }
        boolean sign = (a > 0 && b > 0) || (a < 0 && b < 0);
        a = a > 0 ? -a : a;
        b = b > 0 ? -b : b;
        int ans = 0;
        while (a <= b) {
            int x = b;
            int cnt = 1;
            while (x >= (Integer.MIN_VALUE >> 1) && a <= (x << 1)) {
                x <<= 1;
                cnt <<= 1;
            }
            ans += cnt;
            a -= x;
        }
        return sign ? ans : -ans;
    }
}

//the provided Java code implements integer division without using division, multiplication, or modulo operators. 
//It handles edge cases, such as division by 1 and potential overflow. 
//The algorithm subtracts the largest multiple of the divisor from the dividend iteratively and keeps track of the count, providing the result with the correct sign.
