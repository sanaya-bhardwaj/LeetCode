//You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, 
//the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and 
//it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
//Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, 
//return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
